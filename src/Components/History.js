      <p>
        During my graduation, I have learned technical and non-technical
        abilities required for flight operations. As a result of my studies, I
        obtained the academic achievement Summa Cum Laude from the university
        due to good grades. After graduation, I worked as a graphic designer
        using computer tools, giving me experience in this area. Then I started
        my contact with the computer science looking for an opportunity that I
        could achieve success while doing something that I love. Currently, I
        just finished the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on
        the Coursera Platform, so I have learned the fundaments of this area
        allowing me to start looking for my first job in this area.
